# palindrome_validation
This is my sml files that I made for my second project in my programming langauges class. 
This will create a function is_palindrome that takes a string as an agrument and determines if it's a palindrome with some helper functions.
I developed this project on a remote linux machine using vim as my text editor. I also created some unit tests for the file which is also included.
